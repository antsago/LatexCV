  \section{Personal profile}
    {
      I'm a fullstack javascript developer.
      I currently find myself most comfortable with the MERN stack,
      but unending curiosity has led me to delve in things as diverse as
      AI, Singe Page and Mobile apps;
      traditional servers and serverless backends;
      and languages like Javascript, Prolog and C\#.
      I take pride in writing quality code that delivers business value
      and my journey to balance short-term business goals against technical best practices
      have made me a fervent believer in constant refactoring and automated testing.
      I'm looking to continue growing, both as a person and as a developer,
      and open to new challenges, locations and experiences.
