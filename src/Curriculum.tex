  \section{Personal profile}
    {
      I am a senior fullstack javascript developer and currently most comfortable in the MERN (Mongo-Express-React-Node) stack and adjacent technologies (like Redux or REST), but I learn fast and have no qualms about diving into new languages and technologies. In fact, throughout my career, you will find examples of projects in Docker, Typescript, Angular, Python, AI and Latex, among others.
      
      I am quite experienced in both the startup and freelancer world and used to working independently in a fast-paced, changing environment. I take pride in writing quality code that delivers value to its users and my journey to balance short-term business goals against technical best practices have made me a fervent believer in constant refactoring and automated testing.

      I am looking to continue growing, both as a person and as a developer, and open to new challenges, projects and locations. So do not hesitate to get in touch! ;)
